# What I have used is the following: 

1. Ubuntu Server
2. Python3
3. Flask
4. Cloud Platform (I use Google Cloud)

# My purpose for this:

#### 1. Setting up (for me) a basic web-server using Flask. 
#### 2. Fetching HTML elements from Flask using JavaScript's fetch
#### 3. I am also using JSON for the fetching.
#### 4. In my later project I will introduce using sha256
#### 5. This is all for practical use only.
